What is Flask?

Flask is a framework for building web applications using the Python programming language.
What is RESTful API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software programs to talk to each other. RESTful means it follows certain principles (like using standard HTTP methods).
What is Flask-RESTful?

Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that makes it easier to build APIs with Flask. It helps organize your code and handle common tasks related to APIs.
What is a Resource?

Think of a resource as something your API deals with. It could be a person, a product, or any other concept in your application.
HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.):

These are like actions you can perform on the resources. For example, GET is used to retrieve information, POST is used to create something new, and so on.
Routing and Endpoints:

Think of endpoints as unique addresses for different parts of your API. It's like saying, "If you want information about X, go to this URL."
Request Parsing:

When someone sends data to your API (like filling out a form), Flask-RESTful helps you easily understand and use that data.
Error Handling:

If something goes wrong (like the user asks for information that doesn't exist), Flask-RESTful helps you respond with a helpful message instead of crashing.
Authentication and Authorization:

Imagine a bouncer at a club. They check your ID (authentication) to make sure you're allowed in. Flask-RESTful helps you add these checks to your API.

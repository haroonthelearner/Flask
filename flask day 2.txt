1. Schemas:
Definition: A schema in Marshmallow is a class that defines the structure and format of your data. It specifies how your Python objects should be converted into a serialized format (marshalling) and how to deserialize incoming data (unmarshalling).

2. Fields:
Definition: Fields are the building blocks of a schema. Each field in a schema corresponds to a property or attribute in your data structure. Marshmallow provides various field types (e.g., Str, Int, List, Nested) to handle different data types and structures.

3. Serialization (Marshalling):
Definition: Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a format suitable for storage or transmission (e.g., JSON). In Marshmallow, this is done using the dump method of a schema.


4. Deserialization (Unmarshalling):
Definition: Deserialization is the process of converting data in a serialized format back into a Python object. In Marshmallow, this is done using the load method of a schema.

5. Nested Fields:
Definition: Marshmallow supports nested fields to handle complex data structures. You can use fields.Nested to include one schema within another.


6. Data Validation:
Definition: Marshmallow allows you to define validation rules for your fields. You can use built-in validators or custom validation functions.

class PersonSchema(Schema):
    name = fields.Str(validate=lambda x: len(x) > 0)
    age = fields.Int(validate=lambda x: x > 0)
class PersonSchema(Schema):
    name = fields.Str(validate=lambda x: len(x) > 0)
    age = fields.Int(validate=lambda x: x > 0)

7. Meta Class:
Definition: The Meta class within a schema allows you to define metadata for the schema. It includes options like specifying additional output formats (json, xml) or custom options.


8. Pre and Post Processing:
Definition: Marshmallow provides decorators (@pre_load, @post_load, @pre_dump, @post_dump) to perform pre and post-processing steps during serialization and deserialization.
